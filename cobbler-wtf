Notes on Cobbler
================
Not sure why a per-system filename of /pxelinux.0 gets added by default for certain netbooted systems with cobbler
in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf after a 'cobbler sync' -- is this a per distro thing? If so can it then be changed
with a 'cobbler distro edit'?

Or better yet, can it be changed on a per-system basis with a 'cobbler system edit'?
